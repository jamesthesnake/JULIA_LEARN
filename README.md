# JULIA_LEARN

Julia Learn is a GitHub-located course that will introduce you to the world of functional programming using the Julia programming language in just 4 Pull Requests.

This course is organized as a coding project, allowing you to complete the course without needing to exit your editor.

Here's how it works: When you decide to start the project, all you need to do is fork the repository. We have prepared 4 separate modules or chapters. Each chapter contains educational material and numerous examples presented in a simple form, assuming no prior knowledge of functional programming. Additionally, each chapter includes several exercises that correspond to the concepts explained. You can solve these tasks at your own pace, and at the end of each chapter, you can open a Pull Request to your fork with the chapter's solutions and mention us (by using our usernames). We would be delighted to provide feedback on your progress, explain any challenging concepts, or offer moral support!

Each chapter contains unique information and covers different topics. We recommend going through them in order. However, if you find some chapters familiar, feel free to skip to the next one. Should you have any questions, you can rely on Pull Requests for the corresponding chapter to communicate with us.

The chapters are filled with information but are designed to be completed without needing additional resources. You may spend an evening per chapter, but we promise it will be worth your time!

By the end of this course, you should be able to independently create and read basic Julia code and have a good understanding of functional programming concepts, including higher-order functions and other famous concepts in functional programming.
